# Edifice TS Client

Edifice TS Client exposes frameworks for interacting with [entcore-based servers APIs](https://github.com/opendigitaleducation/entcore).
It is written in typescript, with minimal dependencies (rxjs and axios at the moment).

## Prerequisites

- `pnpm: >= 7 | 8`
- `node: >= 16 | 18`

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Build

```bash
pnpm run build
```

## Documentation

As rule of thumb, **edifice-ts-client never uses any browser-related technology** (no HTMLElement, Document, navigator...). 
It focus exclusively on data exchange with the servers.

* [IConfigurationFramework](docs/interfaces/iconfigurationframework.md) is composed of 3 layers
  * Platform (apps, theme, analytics, i18n...)
  * School
  * User (preferences)

* [ISession](docs/interfaces/isession.md) of the connected user
  * user
  * description
  * currentLanguage
  * notLoggedIn
  * avatarUrl
  * currentApp (the one which initialized the framework)
  * hasWorkflow
  * hasRight

* [INotifyFramework](docs/interfaces/inotifyframework.md) for async messages
  * onLangReady
  * onSessionReady
  * onSkinReady
  * onOverridesReady
  * promisify (generic for creating/resolving/rejecting a Promise)
  * events (a publish/subscribe event broker)

* [ITransportFramework](docs/interfaces/itransportframework.md) wraps the HTTP protocol

* [IExplorerFramework](docs/interfaces/iexplorerframework.md) to look for resources

* [IWidgetFramework](docs/interfaces/iwidgetframework.md) dedicated to widgets conf/prefs

* and specific app frameworks for modeling their data
  * [ITimelineApp](docs/interfaces/itimelineapp.md)
  * ...

## Additional developers notes

4 additional libs are installed by the ```pnpm install``` command.
* [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/) as a Bundler
* [Typedoc](https://typedoc.org/guides/doccomments/) to generate the markdown documentation, in **/docs**, from the Typescript comments in source code.
* [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to install a local [git pre-commit hook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks#_client_side_hooks), in order to run the unit-tests and update /docs before every commit.
  => **/docs will always be up-to-date on the git server**.

The ```pnpm run build``` command will populate the **/dist** directory
* **/dist/ts** contains the JS code and associated _.d.ts_ and _.js.map_ files, later packaged in NPM (done by our CI).
* **/dist/bundle** contains the production-ready code/map.

So, **you'll just have to write nice documented code, and unit tests** where needed !

## Push Force

`git push --force` is not recommended!

```
After a git history rewrite due to a git push --force, the git tags and notes referencing the commits that were rewritten are lost.
```

If it happens, read this troubleshooting section: [Troubleshooting](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/support/troubleshooting#release-not-found-release-branch-after-git-push-force)
