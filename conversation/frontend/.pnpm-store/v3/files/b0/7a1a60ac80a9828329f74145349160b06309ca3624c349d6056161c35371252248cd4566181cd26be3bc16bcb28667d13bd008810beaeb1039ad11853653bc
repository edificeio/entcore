## Getting Started

### How to

To add a new icon to the library:

- Add a new `*.svg` to assets

### Build

```bash
pnpm run build
```

- Create all React Icons Components based on `*.svg` files from `assets` folder and import them all inside `index.tsx` file

### Lint

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

```bash
pnpm run fix
```

If `pnpm run lint` shows issues, run this command to fix them.

### Prettier

```bash
pnpm run format
```

This command starts `format:check` + `format:write`

## Dev

You can test your Icon Component using `Storybook` or `Playground`. See [README](../../apps/docs/README.md)
